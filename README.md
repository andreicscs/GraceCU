# GraceCU  
## üìò Background & Evolution  
This project started as part of the [GRACE](https://github.com/Fairswing/Grace) learning initiative, which was designed to help students understand the fundamentals of artificial intelligence by implementing neural networks from scratch using backpropagation and gradient descent.  

### üéì Academic Purpose  
As the scope grew, the neural network component evolved into a standalone **academic library**. The focus is now on **clarity, modularity, and educational value** rather than raw performance. 
***The library is intended as a learning tool for students who want to understand how neural networks work internally, step by step.*** 
The library includes detailed comments that explain the code‚Äôs behavior, linking each implementation to the underlying mathematical formulas and clarifying both what they do and why it works that way.

## üß© Project Structure  
The project currently consists of two main libraries:  

- **`Matrix.h`** ‚Üí A custom matrix library implementing core operations.
- **`NeuralNetwork.h`** ‚Üí A neural network library built on top of `Matrix.h`.  
### üìä MNIST Demo  
A demo application is provided to train and test a simple neural network on the **MNIST digit recognition dataset**, demonstrating the use of `Matrix.h` and `NeuralNetwork.h` in practice.

## üßÆ Matrix Library (`Matrix.h`)  

### Features  
- Matrix creation and deletion  
- Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication)  
- Element-wise operations  
- Scaling and transposition  
- Matrix storage and loading from files  

### TODO  
- Write unit tests  
- Improve documentation  
- Optimize matrix multiplication  
- (Optional) Reintroduce CUDA kernels for GPU acceleration in the future

## üß† Neural Network Library (`NeuralNetwork.h`)  

### Features  
- Dynamic network architecture  
- Activation functions: Sigmoid, ReLU, Softmax  
- Loss functions: CCE, MSE, BCE  
- Training with batch processing  
- Model persistence (save/load network states)  
- Accuracy and loss computation
- Nural network prediction (to use the trained neural network)

### TODO  
- Expand test coverage (known-answer tests or test helpers)  
- Improve documentation (full API docs, install/run instructions)  
- Add regularization and optimizers (Adam, RMSProp, etc.)  
- Add support for dropout, batch normalization, and convolutional layers  
- Provide more didactic examples and exercises  

---

## üìò Documentation
For a full API reference and usage details, check out the [üìñ Documentation](./docs/API.md).

---

## üöÄ Future Plans  
- Expand the library with additional layers and functions  
- Provide exercises/tutorials for students  
- Improve ease of use with data loading and data manipulation functions
- (Optional) Revisit CUDA or multithreading if performance becomes a focus  

## ü§ù Feedback  
This project is still under development. Contributions, suggestions, or feedback from students and educators are very welcome!
